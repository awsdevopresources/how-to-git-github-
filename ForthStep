After configuring token, when you generate it, copy it in secure folder, 
because you will need to use it instead of password. 

When you want to push changes, you will need:

1. E-mail address - email you use it to register on GitHub profile in 
   our case that is example@gmail.com

2. Password -> this is now your generated token which is connected with 
   our GitHub profile

After this you will be possible to upload changes on your GitHub profile.
