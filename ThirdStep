After configuring global user or configuring user per project 
(https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-configure-git-username-and-email/), 
third step is to generate SSH to configure GitHub account with user computer
 (local computer), before this step you should already have created GitHub account. 

How to generate SSH key on your local computer: 
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key#_generate_ssh_key

After this step, you need to copy SSH key in GitHub account. 

Your Email Addresses
The way that GitHub maps your Git commits to your user is by email address. If you use
multiple email addresses in your commits and you want GitHub to link them up properly,
you need to add all the email addresses you have used to the Emails section of the admin section.

CREATING TOKEN for GitHub account

Before token, user needed to have password to upload files on remote GitHub account, 
but after August 2021, user need to create token. When you want to push changes on your GitHub accoount
you need to authenticate with token. On this link you will find how to do this:
